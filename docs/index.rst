CoronaLab: creating synthetic corona observations
=================================================

This package allows the user to create synthetic data products from a 3D model of a stellar coronal magnetic field. Extrapolating the coronal magnetic field and tracing field lines is not included so users can choose whatever method they want (e.g. sunkit-magex).
